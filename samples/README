These are two, 60 second samples for exercising the stretch algorithms. They are
encoded with the WavPack lossless codec, so they'll need to be converted back to
Microsoft WAV files to be used. One is mono, and the other is a stereo version
of the first, but with one channel delayed 1/2 sample.

These are not speech samples, but are artificially generated test signals. They
consist of a warbling tone (between 75 and 1500 Hz) and varying levels of noise.
They are also generated at a high level (in some places clipping) to verify the
proper operation of the stretch code with edge-case values.
